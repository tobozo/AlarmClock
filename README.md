# DCF77 Time/Weather gatherer 

This project is a mix of @FroggySoft's [AlarmClock](https://github.com/FroggySoft/AlarmClock) and arduino-projects4u's [weather-station](http://arduino-projects4u.com/home-weather-station/) stripped down from external dependencies and adapted to work on an ESP32-Arduino platform.

It is intended to work with [Universalsolder's DCF77](https://www.tindie.com/products/universalsolder/atomic-clock-am-receiver-kit-dcf77-wwvb-msf-jjy60/) but may as well work with other models.
